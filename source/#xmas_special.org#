- Understanding and using loops in a game development
- Learning using if statements (conditionals) to branch instructions in a solution
- Learning what computers events are and how they are used in game development

** The Game Play
:PROPERTIES:

:END: 
- Santa's sleigh can move up and down along the left side a game screen
- Santa's move is controlled by UP and DOWN arrow keys
- A present is randomly placed at the right edge of the screen
- The present is moving at an initial speed towards the left of the screen
- When Santa collides with the present, the present disappears and Santa gets one point
- Another present appears at the right edge, but with increased speed
- The game is over when Santa misses a pr

- As a human, you find that sorting the scores from 8 teams is quite easy.
- But what about sorting the whole year's? the whole school's? You can, but it will take you a much longer time.
- You may be already thinking about computers and using spreadsheet to help you sort a much longer list of scores.
- But humans must create spreadsheet software first. What's more the spreadsheet software humans created must be able to sort numbers.
- When we deal with large amount of data and more complex problems, computers can *help* us to solve those problems more quickly than humans can, *BUT* humans must describe the steps to solve the problems to the computers first.
- *Computational thinking* is the thought processes of understanding a problem and presenting its solution(s) in such a way that a computer can effectively carry out.

   1. Humans must develop possible solutions
   2. Humans must present the solutions in a way computers can understand
   3. Computers can only help us solve problems
